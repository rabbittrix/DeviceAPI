* Device API tests

* to start npm i
* npm start

* Use Postman or oder
http://localhost:3000/api

* Database MongoDB

*Taking the opportunity to test the performance of the apis, there is a lot to take advantage of, such as:
cache to control horizontal api scaling with a vertical database, so it doesn't crash the database.

have fun!!!
